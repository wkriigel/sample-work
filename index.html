                                    <p>Created an overview feature that summarized modular steps that needed to be completed before running a campaign. Users had the need to review required elements at a glance without having to revisit each object individually. This was centered around the concept of a dynamic, readable sentence that explained the connection between each component and its status. This design validated each step and provided a flexible completion order that a traditional linear wizard might not.</p>

                                    The PhishTACO app had a need for a fresh approach to its look and feel. A cohesive brand visual identity was established featuring bright colors, soft shadows, and subtle animations to create a more approachable and standout product. Panels, progress bars, alerts, form inputs, buttons, and other UI elements each with different states were handcrafted and compiled into a design library for engineer use. This styling approach achieved the application's memorability and distinctiveness.</p>

                                <p>With over a decade of UI/UX experience, I've ranged from handling general
                                    front-end work as a solo designer to specializing in optimizing complex cyber
                                    security workflows for multi-departmental organizations. My focus is on ensuring
                                    that every design decision enhances user ease, efficiency, and empathy.<br><br>
                                    I live near Atlanta, GA, with my wife, two rambunctious black kittens, and two spry senior dachshunds. I'm also a competitive powerlifter, actively
                                    training and participating in local and regional events as well running a small team
                                    out of my garage gym. By balancing a love for design with my passion for animals
                                    and fitness, I find joy in both creative and physical challenges.</p>
