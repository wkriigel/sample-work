                <h3>Credentials Too Isolated</h3>
                <p>
                  Sophos is a large cyber security organization with a suite of several security products. The Central Management Console
                  existed as a hub and single access point but the suite was still grappling with a
                  <mark>fragmented system</mark>
                  where each product
                  <mark>required separate credential configuration</mark>
                  and individual management.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Credentials play a critical role in allowing products to interact with the user's estates and other third-party product
                  connections. They consist of username/password pairs, API keys, tokens, access permissions, and other related
                  configurations that <mark>must be managed securely</mark>.

                <h3>User Burden and Security Risks</h3>
                <p>
                  Users had given feedback that they were frustrated with the
                  <mark>redundancy</mark>
                  and complexity of managing separate credentials for each product, and security experts were concerned about the potential
                  <mark>risks</mark>
                  associated with this disjointed approach:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <em>Lack of high level overview:</em>
                    Credential audits and monitoring were left to each product and if supported would need individual review.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>More opportunities for error:</em>
                    By adding credentials separately there was a higher risk for misconfiguration and more steps involved in remediation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>Consistency and Standards:</em>
                    Different products used different methods and would have an increased learning curve and potential for confusion.

                <h3>A Headstart from an Acquired Product</h3>
                <p>
                  The coming changes were finally sparked by the acquisition of the DevSecOps workflow automation tool, <em>Factory</em>,
                  which revealed a
                  <mark>significant opportunity to leverage its credential manager</mark>
                  for the rest of the Sophos offerings. Factory's version highlighted the benefits of a unified system, but it also
                  underscored the inefficiencies of the existing system in the Central Management Console.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since I was the Security Operations UX Designer on Factory, my task was to design a Global Credential Manager that would
                  start with its approach but extend to cover the rest of Sophos' user's needs. It would not only consolidate the management
                  of credentials
                  <mark>across all Sophos products</mark>
                  but also enhance security and streamline user operations with new features. This system needed to be intuitive, secure,
                  and
                  <mark>capable of integrating seamlessly with the existing product ecosystem</mark>. This would also be a mutually
                  beneficial first step that would align with a future project of integrating all of Factory's capabilities into the Central
                  Management Console.

                <h3>From Concept...</h3>
                <h4>Gathering Insights</h4>
                <p>
                  The project kicked off with in-depth
                  <mark>consultations with security experts</mark>
                  to align the design with the best security practices. I also gathered the
                  <mark>feedback taken from Factory's implementation</mark>
                  to dive deep into the usersâ€™ pain points and gather actionable insights. Shortcomings identified there would include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <em>No Granular Permissions:</em>
                    A need to control what actions a credential can take.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>No Individualized Product Access:</em>
                    A need to control where actions can take place.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>No Bulk Management:</em>
                    Overview usage metrics, mass suspension and expiration options.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Visualizing Features</h4>
                <p>
                  During these initial meetings I took inventory of objects and access paths, particularly what data and connections users
                  would be interfacing with.
                  <mark
                    >By creating quick visuals on the fly stakeholders were able to understand how this might come together and have an
                    easier time contributing requirements</mark
                  >. After these sessions, wireframes and flows were presented to and agreed upon by the PM, security team, and engineers. I
                  then moved to high-fidelity prototypes which could be rapidly built using Sophos' design system and Figma component
                  library. Getting to this point quickly was important as mockups that look closer to the final output were easier for all
                  members of the team to digest. The design process at this point continued to be
                  <mark>flexible and iterative, involving multiple rounds of workflow examination</mark> to refine the interface and
                  functionality. Notable features here included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <em>Branching Configuration:</em>
                    New product configurations would need to choose to add a new credential or select an existing one. I prioritized the
                    adding of a new credential since it was the more common case and always relevant to new users.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>Three-Step Credential Creation Wizard:</em>
                    If adding a new credential users would proceed to a wizard that would guide them through the process in logical thematic
                    steps rather than overwhelm them with the complexity of all fields at once.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>Global Management Table:</em>
                    A sortable and filterable table that would show statues, metadata, and controls for credentials. This was an important
                    aspect of the credential overview.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>Bulk Actions:</em>
                    Provided the ability to control many credentials at once, whether it was enabling, suspending, or deleting. This
                    required context considerations when selecting multiple types of credentials.
                  </li>

                <h3>...To Reality</h3>
                <h4>Engineering Collaboration</h4>
                <p>
                  Throughout the design phase and development phases, I maintained a close collaboration with the engineering team. Some
                  sprints required daily calls with international teams. This
                  <mark>partnership</mark>
                  ensured that the design specifications were not only technically feasible but also aligned with Sophosâ€™ stringent security
                  requirements.
                  <mark>Gaps and edge cases in the mockups were addressed quickly</mark>
                  and requirements were clarified as needed.
                </p>
                <h4>Navigating Challenges and Prioritizing Features</h4>
                <p>
                  One of the significant challenges faced during the project was the need to adhere to
                  <mark>strict timeline restrictions</mark>, which necessitated a strategic approach to feature development. To address
                  immediate user needs and ensure a timely rollout, we decided to focus on creating a minimum viable product (MVP) that
                  included only the most critical features. This approach allowed us to launch a functional system that could be enhanced in
                  later phases. The prioritization of features was carefully managed in collaboration with project managers and security
                  experts. Together, we
                  <mark>identified and implemented urgent security features</mark>
                  that were essential for the first phase of the final implementation, ensuring that the most impactful elements were ready
                  at launch while planning for future enhancements. Some aspects of user workflow optimization were designed but implemented
                  in a more limited way that required fewer new components.

                <p>
                  The <mark>deployment</mark> of the Global Credential Manager marked a significant improvement in how credentials were
                  managed at Sophos. Users now had access to a streamlined process that
                  <mark>saved time</mark>
                  by offering the ability to reuse credentials but also the
                  <mark>power to oversee</mark>
                  and manage them from a single location without drilling down into each product to maintain them. The unified approach also
                  <mark>bolstered security</mark>, incorporating advanced features like granular access controls and comprehensive usage
                  logs and metrics.
                </p>
                <h4>Strategic Impact</h4>
                <p>
                  Beyond the immediate benefits, the Global Credential Manager facilitated smoother integration of the Factory product into
                  Central,
                  <mark>setting a precedent for future acquisitions</mark>. The project received positive feedback from stakeholders
                  including those outside of the team who would need the changes made here to move forward with their own projects,
                  highlighting its impact on <mark>reusability and access to credentials for automation processes</mark>.
                </p>
                <h4>Future Directions</h4>
                <p>
                  After the success of this project's first phase, plans are underway to
                  <mark>further enhance the Global Credential Manager based on user feedback and more thorough security expectations</mark>.
                  The timeline limitations on this project meant that not all ideas were fully engineered in the initial pass.
                  Prioritization and compromises had to be made for creating the most effective version of this tool with room to expand
                  capabilities that were left in the evaluation and design stage.
