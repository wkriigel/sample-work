                <h3>First Launch Unsuccessful</h3>
                <p>
                  Georgia Tech's Research Institute was off to a rough start with their existing internal document routing application.
                  Government and research contracts, proposals, and security arrangements had started transitioning from paper forms passed
                  between offices but the results were <mark>primitive, inconsistent, and slow to develop</mark>. The eRouting project aimed
                  to give these apps a much needed makeover.

                <h3>No Satisfaction</h3>
                <p>The eRouting system required a fundamental transformation due to several key challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <em>No established design process or standards:</em><br />
                    The front-end was left <mark>virtually undesigned</mark>. There was no branding, no styling, no consistency. Workflows
                    were clunky and the experience was not intuitive.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>High levels of customer dissatisfaction:</em><br />
                    <mark>Customers did not feel like they received a valuable purchase.</mark> The internal departments paying for these
                    applications were hesitant to return and looking for third-party tools rather than custom made solutions we provided.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>Unacceptably long application development times:</em><br />
                    Every delivery was far behind schedule. There was no front-end code reusability.
                    <mark>Scaling and bug fixing were severely limited.</mark>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  These problems sourced from a <mark>lack of design planning and user research</mark> as there was no one in the UI/UX role
                  on the development team.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The first step was to <mark>open up Customer-Developer communications</mark>. Rather than only department heads requesting
                  specific solutions, I was able to meet with the actual day-to-day users of the routing process and discuss their current
                  tasks and pain points. Beyond the cleanup, I was able to gather insights about additional problem areas such as
                  attachments, comments, and linking related documents to each other. I kept these lines open throughout the process and
                  would regularly check in as a part of each sprint demo.

                  <h3>Structure Has Arrived</h3>
                  <h4>Looking Like A Yellow Jacket</h4>
                  <p>
                    To begin to address the visual inconsistencies, I evaluated several UI frameworks and settled on Bootstrap even though
                    it would need some modifications for our needs. This led to a new general structure that would be
                    <mark>used in eRouting and in all other applications</mark> coming from our department:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <em>Title bars:</em>
                      A shared suite-wide global menu, an app specific menu, page title, and content headers to give
                      <mark>consistent navigation and status awareness</mark>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Collapsible sidebar:</em>
                      For providing <mark>persistent access</mark> paths within the current document's subforms, attachments, and related
                      items.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Responsive Design:</em>
                      Approvals needed to happen on the go or quickly during meetings so a <mark>mobile friendly</mark> design was needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Branding:</em>
                      Once the framework was in place I incorporated the <mark>Georgia Tech branding</mark> to bring the iconic gold into
                      the styling.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="text">
                <h4>Introducing Components</h4>
                <p>
                  Beyond this there was still a <mark>need for speeding up the development time</mark>. Bootstrap offered powerful pre-built
                  classes but every detail needed to be specified and required expertise from a UI dev. All engineers need to be able to use
                  these new features but it wasn't practical or efficient for them to expand their responsibilities in this direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To solve this <mark>I took the initiative to transition the team to using templated web components</mark>, a practice that
                  was not in place in the department. Previously every element was written in raw HTML by hand or copied and pasted, which
                  was far from a sustainable practice. To facilitate this
                  <mark>I developed a design system with a component library, style guide, and usage documentation.</mark> Buttons, form
                  fields, icons, and more complex features such as dynamic progress bars were created with examples showing status variants
                  and notes about how they should be used.

                <h3>Make It Easier</h3>
                <p>
                  Beyond the UI changes, I implemented design principles to give eRouting users more comfort and familiarity at every
                  opportunity across the application.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <em>Workflow Patterns:</em><br />
                    Added a universal action center to approve, deny, and route all document types from the same place across all flows.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>Error Prevention:</em><br />
                    Incorporated inline validation, hints, tooltips, and support links. Changed form fields to use selects and autocompletes
                    where possible to reduce the chance for inappropriate data.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>Increased User Control:</em><br />
                    Allowed users to save at any time. Supported a withdraw action to undo submissions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>Engineer Assistance:</em><br />
                    Documented best practices for implementing items in the Design Library.

                <h3>A New Era</h3>
                <p>
                  The overhaul of eRouting was a <mark>massive success</mark> and shifted the perception of the development team.
                  <mark
                    >Users were excited to use the application and take advantage of the increased capabilities in their daily work.</mark
                  >
                  Plans were underway to extend eRouting to more document types. Engineers also felt empowered to use the design system.
                  Speed of feature delivery was magnitudes faster with a <mark>front-end code reduction of 95%</mark>. We were now able to
                  deliver better looking and easier to use products faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That said, there was still room for improvement. More comprehensive user testing would make sure that development was
                  focused on useful features. Solutions could be built with future scalability in mind rather than individual quick fixes.
                  Communicating the trade-offs and benefits of different UI choices to stakeholders could have been done more clearly when
                  all presented options do not have equal impacts.
