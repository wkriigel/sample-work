                <h3>Previous Launch Unsuccessful</h3>
                <p>
                  Before I arrived, Georgia Tech's Research Institute was off to a rough start with their existing internal document routing
                  application. Government and research contracts, proposals, and security arrangements had started transitioning from paper
                  forms passed between offices but the results were <mark>primitive, inconsistent, and slow to develop</mark>. The eRouting
                  project aimed to give these apps a much needed makeover.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                <img class="frame" src="images/gt-before.png" />
                <div class="caption">Before. Users were not pleased with the system as delivered.</div>
              </div>
              <div class="text">
                <p>The eRouting system required a fundamental transformation due to several key challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <em>No established design process or standards:</em><br />
                    The front-end was left <mark>virtually undesigned</mark>. There was no branding, no styling, no consistency. Workflows
                    were clunky and the experience was not intuitive.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>High levels of customer dissatisfaction:</em><br />
                    The application <mark>looked outdated and had the same feel as a paper form</mark> not a modern digital solution.
                    Customers did not feel like they received a valuable purchase. The internal departments paying for these applications
                    were hesitant to return and looking for third-party tools rather than custom made solutions we provided.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>Unacceptably long application development times:</em><br />
                    Every delivery was far behind schedule. There was no front-end code reusability.
                    <mark>Scaling and bug fixing were severely limited.</mark>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  These problems sourced from a lack of design planning and user research as there were no such processes in place on the

                  and discuss their current tasks and pain points. Beyond the cleanup, I was able to gather insights about additional
                  problem areas such as attachments, comments, and linking related documents to each other. I kept these lines open
                  throughout the process and would regularly check in as a part of each sprint demo.

                  <h3>Structure Has Arrived</h3>
                  <p>
                    To begin to address the visual inconsistencies, I evaluated several UI frameworks and settled on Bootstrap even though
                    it would need some modifications for our needs. This led to a new general structure that would be used in eRouting and
                    in all other applications coming from our department:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <em>Title bars:</em><br />
                      A shared suite-wide global menu, an app specific menu, page title, and content headers to give
                      <mark>consistent navigation and status awareness</mark>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Collapsible sidebar:</em><br />
                      For providing persistent access <mark>paths and guidance through required steps</mark> within the current document's
                      subforms, attachments, and related items.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Responsive Design:</em><br />
                      Approvals needed to happen on the go or quickly during meetings so a <mark>mobile friendly</mark> design was needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Branding:</em><br />
                      Once the framework was in place I incorporated the <mark>Georgia Tech branding</mark> to bring the iconic gold into
                      the styling.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="text">
                <h4>Introducing Components</h4>
                <p>
                  Beyond this there was still a <mark>need for speeding up the development time</mark>. Bootstrap offered powerful pre-built
                  classes but every detail needed to be specified and required expertise from a UI dev. All engineers need to be able to use
                  these new features but it wasn't practical or efficient for them to expand their responsibilities in this direction at the
                  time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To solve this <mark>I took the initiative to transition the team to using templated web components</mark>, a practice that
                  was not in place in the department. Previously every element was written in raw HTML by hand or copied and pasted, which
                  was far from a sustainable practice. To facilitate this
                  <mark>I developed a design system with a component library, style guide, and usage documentation.</mark> Buttons, form
                  fields, icons, and more complex features such as dynamic progress bars were created with examples showing status variants
                  and notes about how they should be used.

                <h3>Make It Easier</h3>
                <p>
                  Beyond the UI changes, I implemented design principles to give eRouting users more comfort and familiarity at every
                  opportunity across the application.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <em>Workflow Patterns:</em><br />
                    Added a universal action center to approve, deny, and route all document types
                    <mark>from the same place across all flows</mark>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>Error Prevention:</em><br />
                    Incorporated inline validation, hints, tooltips, and support links. Changed form fields to use selects and autocompletes
                    where possible to <mark>reduce the chance for inappropriate data</mark>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>Increased User Control:</em><br />
                    Allowed users to <mark>save at any time and come back when ready</mark>, rather than only submitting a completed form.
                    <br />And included a "withdraw proposal" action to <mark>undo submissions that might need changes</mark>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>Engineer Assistance:</em><br />
                    Wrote in-page tutorials for engineers, documenting <mark>how to include new design components</mark> quickly and
                    correctly into new forms.

                <h3>A New Era</h3>
                <p>
                  The overhaul of eRouting was a <mark>massive success</mark> and elevated the capabilities of the development team.
                  <mark
                    >Users were excited to use the application and take advantage of the increased speed and capabilities in their daily
                    work.</mark
                  >
                  Plans were underway to extend eRouting to more document types. Engineers also felt empowered to use the design system.
                  Feature delivery was magnitudes faster with a <mark>front-end code reduction of 95%</mark>. We were now able to deliver
                  better looking and easier to use products faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That said, there was still room for improvement. More comprehensive user testing would make sure that development was
                  focused on useful features. Solutions could be built with future scalability in mind rather than individual quick fixes.
                  Communicating the trade-offs and benefits of different UI choices to stakeholders could have been done more clearly when
                  all presented options do not have equal impacts.
